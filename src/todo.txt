For 3.4 (this is a plan, not a promise):
* switch most ebooks to use mupdf
* merge TreeModel refactor
* pdfprint
* remove unused code
* make it easy (one-click) to upgrade daily builds (all builds?)
* tooltip for tabs showing full path of the file
* https://github.com/sumatrapdfreader/sumatrapdf/pull/1757 translation / search of selected text
* change how translations work
* merge pre-release and daily builds (as daily builds)
* automatic updates for daily builds
* make updates of release easier
* running installer as admin should install to program files (so that it
  works for non-admin users). Maybe add -for-all cmd-line arg / checkbox
